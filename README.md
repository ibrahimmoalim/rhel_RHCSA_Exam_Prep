## troubleshooting virt-manager

- if you get network 'default' is not active (the virtual network switch that your VM relies on to connect to the outside world isn't running) when you try to run a VM, open the terminal and run:
    ```bash
    sudo virsh net-start default
    ```
    Set it to autostart (so you don't have to deal with this error again after a reboot):
    ```bash
    sudo virsh net-autostart default
    ```

## terminal shortcuts

- ctrl+a => go to the start of line (command)
- ctrl+e => go to the end
- ctrl+u => clear line
- ctrl+l => clear terminal

- when viewing pages like `man` pages in the terminal, use these keys or shortcuts to move around:
    - g => go to top
    - shift+g => go to bottom
    - up and down arrow keys => move up and down
    - hold enter => go down
    - space move down a whole page
    - /(pattern) => search for a string, like /list (shows all 'list')
    - n => go to the next search result item (top to bottom)
    - shift+n => go to the prev search result item (top to bottom)
    - ?(pattern) => same as '/' but it's reversed so 'n' is go to next item (bottom to top)
    - q => quit

## terminal commands

- `tree -d` => `tree` command but only shows directories
- `tree -d -L 1` =>  `tree -d` but only shows 1 **level** (the first directories, like doing ls but only seeing directories, you can use higher numbers like 3 to see 3 levels)
```bash
~/mobile_project_demo$ tree -d -L 3

```
- `tree -d -L 2 ./mobile_project_demo/` => using the tree command target a specific dir in cwd

## extra terminal notes

- a **#** infront of a command makes it do nothing, comments it out
